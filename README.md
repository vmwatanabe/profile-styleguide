# profile-styleguide

## What is this?

This is part of the Profile Micro FrontEnd project. All repositories that start with 'profile-' in my GitHub profile are part of this project. The goal is to showcase the [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/) framework. You can see it live in [here](https://watanabethedev.com/)!

## Local development

To run this locally, you will eigher have to run all parcels or modify the profile-root's "systemjs-importmap" script inside src/index.ejs. If you run all parcels, no change is required. All applications run with 'yarn start' command.
